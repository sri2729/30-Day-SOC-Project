# 🛡️ 30-Day SOC Analyst Challenge 🚀  
This repository contains my work from the **30-Day SOC Analyst Challenge**, where I gained hands-on experience in **Security Operations Center (SOC) analysis, threat detection, and incident response** by configuring SIEM solutions, simulating cyberattacks, and investigating security incidents.  

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
The **goal** of this project is to bridge the gap between **theoretical knowledge** and **real-world SOC skills** by working with tools like **Elasticsearch (ELK), Splunk, Mythic C2, Sysmon, and TryHackMe Labs**.  

### ✅ **Topics Covered**
The challenge is divided into four weeks, each focusing on different SOC-related activities:

- **Week 1: ELK Stack Setup & Log Ingestion**
  - Set up **ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK)**
  - Ingest logs from **Windows endpoints (Sysmon)**
  - Configure **custom dashboards** and alerts in Kibana

- **Week 2: Brute Force Attacks & Detection**
  - Simulate **Brute Force attacks on SSH and RDP**
  - Analyze failed login attempts using **SIEM**
  - Write **detection rules** to trigger alerts in Kibana/Splunk

- **Week 3: Command & Control (C2) Analysis**
  - Deploy and configure **Mythic C2 framework**
  - Execute and detect **C2 beaconing activity**
  - Identify **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**

- **Week 4: Ticketing & Incident Investigation**
  - Set up a **ticketing system** for SOC workflow
  - Investigate **real-world attack scenarios**
  - Write **Incident Response reports**
